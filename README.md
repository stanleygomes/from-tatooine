# [From Tatooine](https://from-tatooine.web.app)

My personal blog. Forked from [Gatsby blog starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) and some inspiration from Abramov Blog [overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io). Syntax theme based on [Sarah Drasner's Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme/) with small tweaks.
