Today we'll learn how to deploy you node app to firebase functions. You can also use [nodevader](https://github.com/stanleygomes/nodevader) boilerplate to do this tutorial.

First, install the Firebase CLI if you don't have it.	

```bash	
npm install -g firebase-tools	
```	

Then, run, login to your firebase account and init a project, right after choose option `functions` and connect it to your project	

```bash
firebase login	
firebase init	
```	

Now, you have a folder called functions. 	

Yes, delete it.	

```bash
rm -rf functions	
```	

Go to the `firebase.json` file and add the `source` property to functions, pointing to current directory:	

```json	
{	
  "functions": {	
    "source": ".",	
    ...	
  }
}
```	

Now install dependencies for firebase	

```bash
npm install --save firebase-admin	
npm install --save firebase-functions	
npm install --save-dev firebase-functions-test	
```	

and, add the required engine property to your `package.json` file	

```json	
  {	
    ...	
    "engines": {	
      "node": "8"	
    }	
  }	
```	

We're almost there. Go to your `src/index.js` file, remove app.listen(...)	

```javascript	
// app.listen(...)	
```	

And the last step. Add functions dependency and export the function.	

```javascript	
const functions = require('firebase-functions')	
// your code here ...	
const api = functions.https.onRequest(app)	
module.exports = {	
  api	
}	
```	

Now you can deploy your function to firebase	

```bash
firebase deploy	
```	

If you want to get the firebase CLI key for CI/CD. Run	

```bash
firebase login:ci	
```	

Thanks and Good luck.
